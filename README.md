# Description
  Employers would like to be able to easily assess an applicants credibility. I have displayed general about me information, a portfolio, a resume, and contact information all in one place. It is easy to access and navigate and includes links to my profiles on multiple sites. It was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, which showcases some skills I have as a developer.
